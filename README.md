#odin-wi5-flow-detection

The objective of this tool is to integrate detection of flows within the Odin framework. The idea is to identify flows belonging to different services, and to report this to the Odin controller. This information will be taken into account when running the different radio resource management algorithms. For example, if a real-time flow has been detected, then the Controller should act in order to grant the delay constraints required by that service.

The detection tool is based on Click modular router. See https://github.com/kohler/click.git

##General scheme of Odin and how the detector is integrated

The next figure shows the general scheme. The part covered in this repository is only the **detector**:
- It receives duplicated traffic flows.
- It periodically sends the information of these flows to the Odin controller. It uses a 5-tuple to define a flow, including IP addresses, ports and protocol.

```

##Scheme of the detector

Every packet that enters to the tap interface will be analyzed and, if necessary, information about the flow will be sent to the Odin controller.

So you first have to duplicate and classify your traffic with another tool. You can do this with e.g. iptables, duplicating the traffic and sending it to the tap interface created by Click (or by you).

```
                  +-----------------------------+
                  |                             |
  in & out       +------+   +-----------------+ |               +----------+
--duplicated---->| ethX |-->| click with      | |--odinsocket-->| odin     |

  of interest     |         +-----------------+ |   port 2819   +----------+
                  |          detector           |
                  +-----------------------------+
                 
               |                                   |
               |     we are covering this part     |
               |<--------------------------------->|
```

##Compile the detector

- Download Click modular router (`git clone https://github.com/kohler/click.git`)

- Copy the two files `detection_agent.cc` and `detection_agent.hh` to `click/elements/local`

- Compile Click with these options
    `~$ ./configure --prefix=/home/proyecto --enable-local --enable-userlevel`

- Build the element list
    `~$ make elemlist`

- Run `~$ make`

You will then have a Click in `click/userlevel/click` including the detection agent.


##Run the detector

Create the `.click` file with the Python script. One example:

    ~$ python detection_agent-click-file-gen.py 192.168.T.Z 2819 192.168.X.Y 2 12 > ../detection.click

And run Click

    ~$ ./click/userlevel/click detection.click

##Duplicate the traffic to be analyzed and direct it to the network interface of the detection machine

You can use the `-j TEE` option of `iptables` to duplicate the traffic. This is an example that works in a kernel 3, but not in a kernel 2.6:

    ~$ iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 192.168.200.3 -j TEE --gateway 192.168.0.4

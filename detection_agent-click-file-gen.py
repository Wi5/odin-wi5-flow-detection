#
# Controlsocket: Communication with the Click application at user level is provided by a 
#TCP/IP based protocol. The user declares it in a configuration file, just like any 
#other element. However, ControlSocket does not process packets itself, so it is not 
#connected with other elements. 
# ControlSocket opens a socket and starts listening for connections.
#When a connection is opened, the server responds by stating its protocol version
#number. After that client can send commands to the Click router. The "server"
#(that is, the ControlSocket element) speaks a relatively simple line-based protocol.
#Commands sent to the server are single lines of text; they consist of words separated
#by spaces
#
# ChatterSocket opens a chatter socket that allows clients to receive copies 
#of router chatter traffic. The "server" (that is, the ChatterSocket element) 
#simply echoes any messages generated by the router configuration to any 
#existing clients.
